## Overview

This Nuxt website is a redo of an old Next.js project that was my previous portfolio website.

Overall, the aim of this website to present and display any side projects that I'm working on, as well as providing some sort of documentation.

## Technology Used

Since this project is using Nuxt, I'm also taking advantage of the Nuxt ecosystem with the various modules available to power several aspects of this site, including the blog and project sections.

I'm also chosen to host this site on Vercel, for easy deployment and integration.
