- Front End Repository
- Backend Repository
- Postman Collection

## Technology Overview

For the frontend UI of this project, I used React (via the `npx create-react-app` command) and Bootstrap for handling CSS.

For the backend stack, I used the following:

- Express.JS, for the main server framework
- MongoDB, for handing database operations and providing data
- Auth0, for handling API authentication tasks

### Web Hosting

Currently, the react app is hosted on Vercel, however, the backend express server is currently offline, due to Heroku shutting down

## API Testing and Documentation

The Listings Finder API was built on REST principles, since I found using that for the API was easier and quicker to get working then using a GraphQL client and being concerned with MongoDB data compatibility.
