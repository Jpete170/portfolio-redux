## Future Plans and My Latest Project

While it has been some time I posted something on this blog, I have been at work with creating and working on several projects, some of which I'll explain below.

I also intend to cover some of my future plans as well, mainly on what project I'll be working on next, as well as revisiting one of my earlier projects.

### My Latest Project

<!-- My latest project was the 'Film Finder' full stack website, using Nuxt.js for the frontend and FastAPI for Python as the backend server application. A full explanation about that project can be found here at *['Film Finder']('/projects/film-finder')*. -->

But to give a quick rundown, 'Film Finder' is a project that allows a user accessing the frontend nuxt.js app to look up a number of TV Shows and Movies based on the Netflix catalogue.

### My Future Plans

So, my future plans involves several things, in (some) particular order they are:

* Learn and Create a project using the .NET Framework
* Revisit the MERN Fullstack project and revamp the frontend and backend functionality to be more flexible
* Learn a new programming language, such as C++, Java or Go, so as to add more programming skills to my skill set / portfolio

It may be some time before I post a project using those new languages (as well as the .NET framework), but I'll endeavour to post an update sometime in June about my progress in whatever I decide to work on first.

### Not so concrete plans

Now for the section about my more up in the air plans, or what I would like to do more so as a hobby, which is Video Game development. I intend to keep this on the 'backburner' of my priorities as such; but I intend to complete some introductory Udemy courses on this subject, and create something worth sharing.

Also, this project will be more involved documentation wise than anything I previously worked on, so I'll create something special for that.
