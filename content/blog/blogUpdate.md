## A Brief Update

Beginning this update. While the time between this post and the previous is not ideal, my personal life has been getting a bit busy, with the end of the University semester fast approach, meaning assessments and work start to pile up, I was also busy applying to graduate positions across several organisations.

When this university semester (at time of writing) is over, a lot more work will be put into this website portfolio, and more projects will be created and worked on.

Which leads to the next section...

## Changes to the Website 

The most obvious change to this site is the cosmetic changes in the 'Blog' page, and the addition of a 'Go Back' button to the blog posts, I plan to work on a complete UI / UX overhaul. This will entail actually adding some colour to this website, finally using some other colours than white, black and grey.

## New Projects 

I haven't been completely idle, I've began work on two projects, a Python-based web scraper, and a JavaScript React app. Both of these projects are in the early stages of their development, so it will be some time before I add them (properly) to my portfolio.
