Hello, and welcome to my website, and my blog. Getting right into it, this first blog post will cover:

- **[About Me](#aboutMe)**
- **[The purpose of the Blog](#purpose)**
- **[My plans for the Blog](#plans)**

## About Me <div id="aboutMe" />

Currently, I am studying a Bachelor of Information Technology, with an emphasis on Mobile Technology, and Business Process Management. I also have an interest in Full Stack Web Development, though currently I am focusing on front end development.

I also have some interest in Video Game development, mainly as a hobby. I do plan to share and document these projects, when I have the time to study game dev. The main language and game engine I plan to focus on is C# and Unity; as Unity uses C# for coding games. I also intend to gain experience using Unreal Engine (and C++), as well as Godot.

I'll provide another blog post detailing my experiences using the above technologies.

### My Skills

At the time of writing this blog post, I am most comfortable writing JavaScript and Python programs. For JavaScript, I have experience with using the [React.JS](https://reactjs.org/) and [Next JS](https://nextjs.org/) frameworks.

My experience with Python programming involves using the Flask framework for a University assignment, and using various frameworks based around Data Analytics (such as [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)), also for University assignments.

## The Purpose of the Blog <div id="purpose" />

Simply, the purpose of this blog is to catalog the projects I plan to work on, and the changes / progress that I make. For now, at least, I plan to expand my knowledge of several programming languages, such as C#, to create some projects worth showing off.

Ultimately, I plan for this website to basically represent my programming resum√®, with each project having a public GitHub repository to display the code. 

## My Plans for the Blog <div id="plans"></div>

My plans for the blog are relatively simple. I plan to create some projects to show off my skill in some different programming languages, and document them in a blog post.
